              <p>How little it may seem, every Thought, Action or Conversation about Love=Truth, the collective Consciousness shifts a little bit to a higher Consciousness. So everything that happens on Earth has influence on our own Consciousness.
</p>
           <p>In this point in time Mankind is shifting from the 3rd Dimension to the 5th Dimension; the highest of Wisdom.
</p>
          <p>
Prophet Mohammed said something about the collective Consciousness.
</p>
<p>He said that when one Person hurts another Person, that this Person actually hurts whole Humanity. 
</p>
<p>This is true, because we are ONE Consciousness.
</p>
<p>But what the Majority of Humanity forgets, is, that Animals are also Part of the collective Consciousness. When we hurt an Animal, we hurt ourselves..</p>
<p>This is very important to keep in Mind!

              <p>The industrial Revolution made us very vulnerable and affected us. It has made us lazy and separated us from Nature.</p>
              <p>Moving from a Money-driven Society to a Society driven by People, their Talents and their Passion for Life.</p>

              <p>...they are emotionally independent, rather than emotionally dependent
...they rely on themselves, rather than social Services or a steady Income and stocked Shelves what will disappear...</p>
              <p>The Assignment of a strong CommUnity puts the delicate Wife of a rich Man in the same Category as a solicitous Mother, and the Bum on the Street in the same Category as a Stock Broker. Both might lack Qualities, but could be a strong Team Member in the CommUnity.</p>
              <p>Any true Service-to-Other Group will not need a Leader. One Person knows this and another one knows that (this covers Men and Women) and with a Combination of all Skills we start to rebuild. The Word ‘Leader’ does have a dictatorial Sound to it.

              <p>And, if one was born a true Leader, one would lead by good Example.

        <h2>WHAT IS ‘2y2d.org’</h2>
      </div>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-12 text-center">
    <div class="intention-content">
      <p>2y2d.org is a “Thought Form”, to do Good and to help. It offers its Service to 'Humanity' and Gaia to make a smooth Transition possible.
</p>
<p>An Idea...an Energy...a growing Awareness.
</p>
<p>For spiritual Beings, a ‘State of Consciousness’, which is based on unconditional Love and mutual Help. An ‘alternative System’ to the ‘present System’.
</p>
<p>It’s not a political Party, as the ‘Thought Form’ any Leadership, as well as Control, which takes the Freedom of each Individual from us, not supports</p>
<p>Faith lies in the Community/Unity of interdependent Networks and Actions instead of Words.
</p>
<p>2y2d.org was launched as Website in English, Spanish and German on the 11 of March 2011 synchronous to the Tsunami in Japan (…the ‘Second Coming’?)
</p>
<p>Some Months earlier ‘States of Consciousness’ created the Collective ‘Anonymous’ and the ‘Arabic Spring’. The ‘Wave of Consciousness’ has since then also evolved into a ‘Tsunami’ worldwide... Coincidence? …Synchronicity.
 </p>
 <p>The original Website of 2y2d.org was online during one year only, as Humanity wasn’t ready at that Time. On a new Strategy was worked on, in which ‘the Vision’ (The Power of Seeing) was brought to the Foreground for the Flow of Information. For easier Comprehension mainly Pictures with little Text were used to help to explain.
</p>
<p>2y2d.org should serve as a Tool, help to remember (Who are we?, Where do we come from?, Where do we go? And Why are we here?) and with the free Download of Pdf-Files shared with the People on the Streets</p>
<p>The idea is, to accompany Mankind in its Evolution of Form of Thought and its State of Consciousness.
</p>
<p>After 7 Years, the ‘2.0 Version’ will focus only on ‘Why are we here?’ and the ‘Organization of the Thought Form’… Solutions
</p>
<p>We need to reeducate the Society ...</p>
<p>and before we inform the Society,</p>
<p>we need to re-educate US and remember...</p>
<p>...there is no Space for Ignorance</p>
<p>Knowledge is Power!</p>
<p>We are in this Together

          <p>Do you feel addressed by the Idea of the "Neighborhoods of Self-Sufficiency" and the interdependent Networks?
</p>
<p>Do you want to create and accompany yourself and your Fellow Man to a Life without Money?
</p>
<p>To carry this out, you need Intelligence, Community Thinking and Stamina.</p>
<p>Because the Task of managing this Project is a Challenge.
</p>
<p>You must always decide for the Benefit of the Community.
</p>
<p>And you plan with Heart and Mind, so that you come into Independence.
